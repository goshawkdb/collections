# GoshawkDB Collections Library

This repo contains the source for the GoshawkDB Collections Library.
Because of the way `go get` requires repos to be laid out, the Go
versions are essentially in the top level directory, whereas other
languages, such as Java have their own directories.

Please see the [documentation](https://goshawkdb.io/documentation/collections.html)
